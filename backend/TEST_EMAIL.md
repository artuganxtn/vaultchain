# How to Test Email Configuration

This guide shows you exactly how to test if your SMTP email setup is working correctly.

## Quick Test Steps

### Step 1: Check Server Startup

1. **Start your server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Look for this message in the console:**
   - ‚úÖ `Email service is ready` = **Email is configured and working!**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è `Email not configured. Using console mode.` = Check your `.env` file

### Step 2: Test Password Reset Flow

1. **Start your frontend** (if not already running)

2. **Navigate to login page**

3. **Click "Forgot Password"** or similar link

4. **Enter your email address** (the one you configured in `.env`)

5. **Click "Send Code"**

### Step 3: Check Results

#### If Email is Configured:
- ‚úÖ Check your email inbox for the reset code
- ‚úÖ Check spam/junk folder if not in inbox
- ‚úÖ Look for email from "VaultChain" with subject "Password Reset Code"
- ‚úÖ The email should contain a 6-digit code

#### If Email is NOT Configured:
- ‚úÖ Check the server console output
- ‚úÖ You'll see something like:
  ```
  ========================================
  üìß [EMAIL - Development Mode]
  To: your-email@example.com
  Your password reset code is: 123456
  ========================================
  ```

### Step 4: Complete the Reset

1. **Enter the 6-digit code** you received (from email or console)

2. **Enter your new password**

3. **Confirm the new password**

4. **Click "Reset Password"**

5. **You should see a success message**

6. **Try logging in with your new password** to verify it worked!

## Method 1: Using the Application (Recommended)

### Test the Full Password Reset Flow:

1. **Start Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```
   
2. **Start Frontend** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and go to the login page

4. **Click "Forgot Password"**

5. **Enter your email address**

6. **Click "Send Code"**

7. **Check where you get the code:**
   - If email configured: Check email inbox
   - If not configured: Check server console

8. **Enter the code and reset your password**

9. **Login with new password** to confirm it worked

## Method 2: Direct API Test (Advanced)

You can test the email sending directly via API:

### Test Request Password Reset:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/request-reset \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"identifier":"your-email@vaultchain.com"}'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{"success": true}
```

**Then check:**
- Your email inbox (if configured)
- Server console (if not configured)

## Method 3: Using a Test Script

I'll create a test script for you (see below).

## What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators:

**Server Console:**
```
Database initialized successfully.
‚úÖ Email service is ready
Server is listening on port 3001
```

**When requesting reset:**
```
‚úÖ Password reset email sent successfully to your-email@vaultchain.com
   Message ID: <xxx@xxx.com>
```

**Email Inbox:**
- Subject: "Password Reset Code - VaultChain"
- Professional HTML email with your code
- 6-digit code clearly displayed

### ‚ùå Failure Indicators:

**Server Console:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Email not configured. Using console mode.
```

**Or:**
```
‚ùå Error sending password reset email: [error message]
```

**Common Errors:**
- `Authentication failed` = Wrong username/password
- `Connection timeout` = Wrong SMTP host or port blocked
- `Server not found` = Wrong SMTP_HOST value

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending?

1. **Check `.env` file exists:**
   ```bash
   cat backend/.env
   ```
   
2. **Verify all 5 variables are set:**
   - SMTP_HOST
   - SMTP_PORT
   - SMTP_SECURE
   - SMTP_USER
   - SMTP_PASSWORD

3. **Check for typos:**
   - No spaces around `=` sign
   - No quotes around values
   - Correct email address format

4. **Restart the server** after editing `.env`

5. **Check server console** for error messages

### Email Goes to Spam?

1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Add sender to contacts
3. For production, configure SPF/DKIM records

### Authentication Failed?

**For Gmail/Google Workspace:**
- Use App Password, not regular password
- Enable 2-Step Verification first

**For Domain Email:**
- Use full email address as username (support@vaultchain.com)
- Double-check password is correct
- Some providers require enabling "Less secure apps"

### Connection Timeout?

1. Try port 465 with `SMTP_SECURE=true`
2. Check if firewall is blocking the port
3. Verify SMTP_HOST is correct
4. Try `smtp.vaultchain.com` instead of `mail.vaultchain.com`
